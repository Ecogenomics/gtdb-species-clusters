# GTDB Species Clusters Toolkit
[![ace-internal](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/ace-internal/gtdb_species_clusters.svg?color=green)](https://anaconda.org/ace-internal/gtdb_species_clusters)

This toolkit provides functionality for establishing, updating, and validating the 
species clusters used in the [Genome Taxonomy Database](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). It is made avaliable for transparency and we are happy for any portions of this code to be reused, but in general the toolkit is meant for internal use by the GTDB team.

Species clusters were introduced in GTDB R04-RS89.
