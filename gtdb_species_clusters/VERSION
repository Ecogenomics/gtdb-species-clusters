0.3.4
- modified genomes.is_effective_type_strain() method to return False if genome is considered to have an untrustworthy NCBI species assignment
- added `ncbi_untrustworthy_sp_ledger` to update_synonyms method to properly handle genomes that shouldn't be considered type strain genomes

0.0.51
- added --rnd_type_genome option for evaluating impact of type genome selection on de novo clusters

0.0.50

0.0.48
- added type species of genus information for resolving priority of species with same publication date
- changed {manual_curation} to {unresolved}
- changed determination of genus name for de novo species clusters to consider most common genus name in cluster
