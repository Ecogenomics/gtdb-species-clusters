0.0.54
- moved code from GenomeTreeTk repository to the GTDB Species Cluster repository
- simplified code to only those methods relevant to species clusters

0.0.53
- better handling of support values when 'stripping' a tree

0.0.52
- modified cluster_de_novo to ensure all genomes as assigned to the closest type genome
- fixed synonym table: species were being indicated as synonyms of multiple species (e.g. Shigella boydii)

0.0.51
- added --rnd_type_genome option for evaluating impact of type genome selection on de novo clusters

0.0.50
- added --gamma option to bootstrap command so it isn't automatically used

0.0.49
- used for GTDB r89
- added QC exception list to qc_genomes command
- added species classification exception list to qc_genomes command
- added species classification exception list to select_type_genomes command
- added species classification exception list to cluster_named_types command
- added GTDB type genomes exception list to select_type_genomes command
- added species type genome radius information to file indicating species clusters
- simplified interface to cluster_user as species ANI radius information is now in cluster file
- stripped 'Candidatus' from all species names

0.0.48
- added type species of genus information for resolving priority of species with same publication date
- changed {manual_curation} to {unresolved}
- changed determination of genus name for de novo species clusters to consider most common genus name in cluster
- added checks to ensure genomes marked as assembled from type material or NCBI representative genomes as not actually a subspecies

0.0.42
- initial implementation of code to assign genomes to canonical genome set 

0.0.41
- fixed bug with parsing contig length from SSU file

0.0.40
- fixed issue with rerooting trees with bootstraps between [0, 1]
